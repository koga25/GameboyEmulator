# GameboyEmulator
Gameboy emulator done with C and SDL2 for the graphics part.

I didn't implement a proper GUI for the project, you have to specify the path of the game on the function call loadGame that is called inside the main function.

Here are some pictures of it working:

<img src="/Pictures/Zelda in game.jpg" alt="">
<img src="/Pictures/Pokemon first screen.jpg" alt="">
<img src="/Pictures/pokemon in game.jpg" alt="">
